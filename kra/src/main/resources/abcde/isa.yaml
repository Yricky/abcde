  - name: General design
    text: >
      VM is register based with dedicated accumulator register, which serves as an implicit operand to instructions.

  - name: Registers
    text: >
      Registers are wide enough to hold a single reference when working with objects.
      When used for primitive types, registers width should be considered as 64 bits.
      When used for object types, registers should be considered wide enough to hold a reference to an object.
      The scope of a register is function frame (also known as activation record). If instruction defines not all 64
      bits of a register, undefined bits shall not be accessed in verified code.
      Register field width in instruction encoding could be 4 (16 addressable registers), 8 (256 registers) or
      16 (65536 registers) bits.

  - name: Accumulator
    text: >
      Accumulator is a special register which is implicitly used by instructions as a source and/or destination operand.
      The main goal of using accumulator is to improve encoding density without losing much in performance. Therefore,
      the general intuition regarding accumulator usage is to utilize the accumulator as much as possible taking it as
      a source from previous instruction result and passing it to the next instruction in its destination operand.
      Moreover, when instruction has more than one source operands, the value which lives shorter should be passed
      through the accumulator. If it is profitable however, variations of instructions that don't write into the
      accumulator are also introduced. For example, moving arguments for `call.range` instruction may be done by
      register-to-register moves.

  - name: Calling sequence
    text: >
      On execution of a call bytecode a new function frame is created. All necessary arguments are copied from the
      caller frame onto the top of the callee frame such as the last argument is placed in the register with the largest
      index and the first argument is placed into the register with the index equal to the size of frame subtracted by
      the number of arguments. Accumulator value is considered as undefined and shall not be read in verified bytecode.
      On return, callee frame is destroyed. If function return value is non-void, it is passed to caller via
      accumulator. Otherwise accumulator content in caller frame is considered as undefined and shall not
      be read in verified bytecode.

  - name: Supported primitive types
    text: |
      VM support operations on registers with i32 and i64 integral values. However, 8-bit and 16-bit integral values
      can be loaded/stored into records and arrays with corresponding bytecodes. In that case, VM will extend/truncate
      value to match storage size with i32. Similarly, passing an 8-bit or 16-bit value to a function can be emulated by
      passing a value, which is zero or sign-extended to i32.
      VM support operations on registers with f32 and f64 values, which corresponds to IEEE-754 single and double precision
      floating-point represenation.
      Primitive data type of a register is not tracked by VM and is interpreted by separate bytecodes.
      Integral values are not inherently signed or unsigned, signedness is interpreted by bytecodes as well.
      If bytecode treats register value as signed integer, it uses two's complement representation.
      To denote that bytecode treats register values as unsigned integer, u32/u64 notation is used.
      For moves, loads and stores it is not always possible to denote a type of result, because it depends on type
      of source object. In that case, bNN notation is used, where NN is bit size of result. Therefore, for example,
      b64 is a union of f64 and i64.

      ### Floating-point literals

      Decimal floating-point literals can have the following parts:

      - Sign ("`+`" or "`-`")
      - Whole number part
      - Decimal point
      - Fractional part
      - Exponent indicator ("`e`")
      - Exponent sign
      - Exponent

      Decimal floating-point literals must have at least one digit and either decimal point or exponent part.

      Special values:

      - Positive zero (+0.0, hexadecimal representation is `0x0000000000000000`)
      - Negative zero (-0.0, hexadecimal representation is `0x8000000000000000`)
      - Minimal positive value (4.9E-324, hexadecimal representation is `0x0000000000000001`)
      - Maximal negative value (-4.9E-324, hexadecimal representation is `0x8000000000000001`)
      - Maximal positive value (1.7976931348623157e308, hexadecimal representation is `0x7fefffffffffffff`)
      - Minimal negative value (-1.7976931348623157e308, hexadecimal representation is `0xffefffffffffffff`)
      - Positive infinity (hexadecimal representation is `0x7ff0000000000000`)
      - Negative infinity (hexadecimal representation is `0xfff0000000000000`)
      - Not a number - set of all NaN values (one of hexadecimal representations is `0x7ff8000000000000`)

  - name: Language-dependent types
    text: >
      Panda VM supports type hierarchies according to the language it executes. That way, creation (or loading
      from constant pool) of strings, arrays, exception objects results into an object of type native to language,
      including inheritance relations.

  - name: Dynamically-typed languages support
    text: >
      Panda VM supports languages with dynamic types. It represents dynamic values through special 'any' values,
      which wraps a value itself (both primitive and objects) and corresponding type info. VM tracks type of registers,
      that hold 'any' value, whether they are primitive or not. Virtual registers and accumulator are wide enough
      to hold 'any' value. When VM executes code inside dynamically-typed language context, regular static instructions
      also may be used.
