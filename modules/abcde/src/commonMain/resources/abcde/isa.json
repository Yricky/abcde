      "text": "Registers are wide enough to hold a single reference when working with objects. When used for primitive types, registers width should be considered as 64 bits. When used for object types, registers should be considered wide enough to hold a reference to an object. The scope of a register is function frame (also known as activation record). If instruction defines not all 64 bits of a register, undefined bits shall not be accessed in verified code. Register field width in instruction encoding could be 4 (16 addressable registers), 8 (256 registers) or 16 (65536 registers) bits.\n"

      "name": "Accumulator",
      "text": "Accumulator is a special register which is implicitly used by instructions as a source and/or destination operand. The main goal of using accumulator is to improve encoding density without losing much in performance. Therefore, the general intuition regarding accumulator usage is to utilize the accumulator as much as possible taking it as a source from previous instruction result and passing it to the next instruction in its destination operand. Moreover, when instruction has more than one source operands, the value which lives shorter should be passed through the accumulator. If it is profitable however, variations of instructions that don't write into the accumulator are also introduced. For example, moving arguments for `call.range` instruction may be done by register-to-register moves.\n"

      "name": "Calling sequence",
      "text": "On execution of a call bytecode a new function frame is created. All necessary arguments are copied from the caller frame onto the top of the callee frame such as the last argument is placed in the register with the largest index and the first argument is placed into the register with the index equal to the size of frame subtracted by the number of arguments. Accumulator value is considered as undefined and shall not be read in verified bytecode. On return, callee frame is destroyed. If function return value is non-void, it is passed to caller via accumulator. Otherwise accumulator content in caller frame is considered as undefined and shall not be read in verified bytecode.\n"

      "name": "Supported primitive types",
      "text": "VM support operations on registers with i32 and i64 integral values. However, 8-bit and 16-bit integral values\ncan be loaded/stored into records and arrays with corresponding bytecodes. In that case, VM will extend/truncate\nvalue to match storage size with i32. Similarly, passing an 8-bit or 16-bit value to a function can be emulated by\npassing a value, which is zero or sign-extended to i32.\nVM support operations on registers with f32 and f64 values, which corresponds to IEEE-754 single and double precision\nfloating-point represenation.\nPrimitive data type of a register is not tracked by VM and is interpreted by separate bytecodes.\nIntegral values are not inherently signed or unsigned, signedness is interpreted by bytecodes as well.\nIf bytecode treats register value as signed integer, it uses two's complement representation.\nTo denote that bytecode treats register values as unsigned integer, u32/u64 notation is used.\nFor moves, loads and stores it is not always possible to denote a type of result, because it depends on type\nof source object. In that case, bNN notation is used, where NN is bit size of result. Therefore, for example,\nb64 is a union of f64 and i64.\n\n### Floating-point literals\n\nDecimal floating-point literals can have the following parts:\n\n- Sign (\"`+`\" or \"`-`\")\n- Whole number part\n- Decimal point\n- Fractional part\n- Exponent indicator (\"`e`\")\n- Exponent sign\n- Exponent\n\nDecimal floating-point literals must have at least one digit and either decimal point or exponent part.\n\nSpecial values:\n\n- Positive zero (+0.0, hexadecimal representation is `0x0000000000000000`)\n- Negative zero (-0.0, hexadecimal representation is `0x8000000000000000`)\n- Minimal positive value (4.9E-324, hexadecimal representation is `0x0000000000000001`)\n- Maximal negative value (-4.9E-324, hexadecimal representation is `0x8000000000000001`)\n- Maximal positive value (1.7976931348623157e308, hexadecimal representation is `0x7fefffffffffffff`)\n- Minimal negative value (-1.7976931348623157e308, hexadecimal representation is `0xffefffffffffffff`)\n- Positive infinity (hexadecimal representation is `0x7ff0000000000000`)\n- Negative infinity (hexadecimal representation is `0xfff0000000000000`)\n- Not a number - set of all NaN values (one of hexadecimal representations is `0x7ff8000000000000`)\n"
